/**
 * Type pairing - chosen for this page specifically, not inherited from the
 * main site.
 *
 * Headings: Fraunces. A low-contrast, warm serif. The main site uses Playfair
 * Display, which is a didone - its hairline strokes thin out badly in white on
 * navy at the sizes this page uses on a 320px screen. Fraunces keeps the serif
 * character the brand is built on while staying sturdy and readable small, and
 * it reads reassuring rather than luxury, which is the right note for someone
 * in pain.
 *
 * Body and UI: Inter. Large x-height, open apertures, and genuine tabular
 * numerals - which matters here, because the phone number is the conversion
 * and it appears eight times.
 *
 * Both are variable fonts, self-hosted and subset by next/font, so this pairing
 * ships fewer bytes than the two static families it replaces.

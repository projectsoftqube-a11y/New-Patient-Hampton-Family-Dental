        Previously these were pill chips in a wrapping flex row, so every chip
        was a different width and the row broke into a ragged, unbalanced
        shape - the logos read as loose stickers rather than a credential set.

        A fixed grid of equal cells fixes that: each logo gets identical space
        and sits optically centred, so the block reads as one tidy panel no
        matter how many carriers the office adds or which ones have artwork.

        Two problems with it as a grid cell: seven cells never fill a row
        cleanly, so it left a visible hole; and it is not a carrier, so giving
        it the same shape as one made it read as a logo that had failed to
        load. Pulled out and widened, it becomes the closing line of the block
        and can carry the phone number itself.

        Someone whose insurer is missing from this grid is exactly the person
        most likely to bounce, so this is a real tel: link rather than the
        inert "+ more - just ask" text it replaces.
